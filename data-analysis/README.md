# About Data Analysis

Data Analysis is the process of collecting, cleaning, transforming, and interpreting data to discover meaningful patterns, trends, and insights that help in making informed decisions.
It’s essentially about turning raw data into useful information.

## ⭐️ Main Steps in Data Analysis

1. **Data Collection** – Gathering data from sources like surveys, databases, APIs, or sensors.

2. **Data Cleaning** – Removing errors, duplicates, or missing values to ensure accuracy.

3. **Data Exploration (EDA)** – Summarizing data using charts and statistics to spot trends or relationships.

4. **Data Transformation** – Converting data into a usable format (e.g., normalizing values, encoding categories).

5. **Modeling / Analysis** – Applying statistical methods or machine learning to make predictions or discover patterns.

6. **Interpretation & Visualization** – Presenting insights using graphs, dashboards, or reports so others can understand them easily.

### Example

Sample Code: 

```
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv("sales.csv")

# Basic statistics
print(df.describe())

# Visualization
plt.plot(df['Month'], df['Sales'], marker='o')
plt.title('Monthly Sales Trend')
plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.ylabel('Sales ($)')
plt.show()
```

Sample Input:

```
Month,Sales

January,15000
February,18000
March,22000
April,21000
```

Expected Output:

```
Summary statistics printed in the console
Line chart showing how sales increase month by month
```
