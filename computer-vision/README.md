# About Computer Vision

Computer Vision (CV) techniques enable machines to understand and interpret visual information from the real world. It involves image processing, feature extraction, and model training to analyze, classify, and make predictions from visual data.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Key Concepts

- **Image Preprocessing**: Resizing, normalization, filtering, and augmentation to enhance image quality.

- **Feature Extraction**: Using edge detectors (Sobel, Canny), SIFT, ORB, or deep CNN embeddings to identify significant visual patterns.

- **Object Detection & Recognition**: Employing models like YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN to detect and classify objects in real time.

- **Segmentation**: Dividing an image into meaningful regions using techniques like U-Net, Mask R-CNN, or thresholding.

- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizing pretrained models (ResNet, VGG, MobileNet) to improve accuracy and reduce training time.

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, IoU (Intersection over Union), mAP (mean Average Precision), Precision-Recall curves.
