# About Random Forests

Random Forests are an ensemble learning method used for classification and regression tasks. They operate by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. This approach helps to improve predictive accuracy and control overfitting compared to a single decision tree.

Random Forests are robust to noise and can handle large datasets with higher dimensionality. They are widely used due to their simplicity, effectiveness, and ability to provide feature importance insights. 

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Key Concepts

- **Ensemble Method**

  Aggregates predictions from many trees to achieve better performance than any single model.
- **Bootstrap Sampling (Bagging)**

  Each tree is trained on a random subset of the dataset with replacement.
- **Feature Randomness**

  At each split, a random subset of features is considered, introducing diversity among trees.
- **Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error**

  Provides an internal unbiased estimate of model accuracy without needing a separate validation set.
- **Feature Importance**

  Measures how much each feature contributes to reducing impurity across all trees.
