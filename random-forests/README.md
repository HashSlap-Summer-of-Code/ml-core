# Random Forests

Random Forests are an ensemble learning method used for classification and regression tasks. They operate by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. This approach helps to improve predictive accuracy and control overfitting compared to a single decision tree.

Random Forests are robust to noise and can handle large datasets with higher dimensionality. They are widely used due to their simplicity, effectiveness, and ability to provide feature importance insights.
