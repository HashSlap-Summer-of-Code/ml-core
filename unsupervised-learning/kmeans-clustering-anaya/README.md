# 🧠 K-Means Clustering in Python

This project implements a clean and modular **K-Means clustering algorithm** using Python and NumPy. It clusters a small 2D dataset and visualizes the results using Matplotlib.

## 📌 Description

- The dataset is randomly generated to simulate 3 clusters in 2D space.
- The K-Means algorithm is implemented from scratch using an object-oriented approach.
- Clustered data points and centroids are visualized on a scatter plot.

## 🚀 Features

- Custom number of clusters (`k`)
- Modular design with `fit`, `predict`, and `plot` methods
- Convergence check with a tolerance threshold
- Easy to extend or reuse

## 🖥️ How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
