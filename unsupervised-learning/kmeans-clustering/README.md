# ðŸ“Š K-Means Clustering

This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch using NumPy.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm Steps:
1. Randomly initialize `k` centroids
2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid
3. Update centroids as the mean of assigned points
4. Repeat until convergence

## ðŸ“Œ Example Dataset:
10 2D points are clustered into 3 groups. The centroids are plotted in black.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
python kmeans.py
