# About Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning each input has a corresponding known output.
The goal is for the model to learn the mapping function between inputs (features) and outputs (labels) so it can make predictions on unseen data.

## ‚≠ê Key Concepts

- **Labeled Data** ‚Äì The training data consists of input-output pairs. For example, an image (input) labeled as ‚Äúcat‚Äù (output).
- **Training Phase** ‚Äì The algorithm learns by minimizing the difference between predicted and actual outputs using a loss function.
- **Testing / Validation Phase** ‚Äì The trained model is evaluated on unseen data to measure its performance and generalization ability.
- **Regression** ‚Äì Used when the output variable is continuous (e.g., predicting house prices).
- **Classification** ‚Äì Used when the output variable is categorical (e.g., spam or not spam).
- **Overfitting / Underfitting** ‚Äì Overfitting happens when the model learns noise instead of patterns; underfitting happens when it fails to learn enough.
- **Evaluation Metrics** ‚Äì Common metrics include Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R¬≤ Score.

## ‚≠ê Common Algorithms

- **Linear Regression** ‚Äì Models the relationship between dependent and independent variables using a straight line.
- **Logistic Regression** ‚Äì Used for binary classification problems.
- **Decision Trees** ‚Äì Splits data into branches based on feature values for prediction.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** ‚Äì Finds the optimal boundary (hyperplane) that best separates data points of different classes.
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** ‚Äì Classifies data points based on the majority class of their nearest neighbors.
- **Naive Bayes** ‚Äì A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes‚Äô Theorem with independence assumptions.
- **Random Forest** ‚Äì An ensemble of decision trees that improves performance and reduces overfitting.
