# About NLP

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It combines linguistics, computer science, and machine learning to process text or speech data and extract meaningful information.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Key Concepts

1. **Text Preprocessing** ‚Äì Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization, and normalization.
2. **Feature Extraction** ‚Äì Representing text as numerical data using techniques like Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, or word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText).
3. **Language Modeling** ‚Äì Predicting the next word or sentence using probabilistic or deep learning models (n-grams, RNNs, Transformers).
4. **Text Classification** ‚Äì Categorizing text (e.g., spam detection, sentiment analysis).
5. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** ‚Äì Identifying entities like names, dates, or locations in text.
6. **Machine Translation** ‚Äì Translating text from one language to another using seq2seq or transformer models.
7. **Text Generation & Summarization** ‚Äì Creating coherent and concise text using models like GPT or T5.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Example: Sentiment Analysis

Code

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load pretrained sentiment analysis model
sentiment = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
result = sentiment(text)

print(result)
```

Input
```
text = "I really love the new update! It's fast and easy to use."
```

Expected Output
```
[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9987}]
```

- The model identifies the sentiment of the input text as positive with high confidence.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Real-World Applications of NLP

- Sentiment analysis of tweets or reviews
- Chatbots and virtual assistants
- Machine translation systems (Google Translate, DeepL)
- Automatic text summarization
- Fake news detection and topic classification
- Information retrieval and question answering
