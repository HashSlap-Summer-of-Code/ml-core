## 🧰 Templates

### 📄 ML Pipeline Template

A reusable and beginner-friendly Python script that demonstrates a typical Machine Learning pipeline.  
Supports CLI usage with [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) for flexible input and automation.

📂 Location: `templates/ml_pipeline_template.py`

#### 💡 Features:
- Load data from CSV/JSON
- Preprocess and split into train/test
- Train a simple ML model (e.g., Logistic Regression)
- Evaluate performance
- Easily adaptable for your own datasets

#### ▶️ How to Run:

python templates/ml_pipeline_template.py --data iris.csv --target species
