## About Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment to achieve a goal.
Instead of learning from labeled data, the agent learns by receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions, refining its strategy over time to maximize long-term rewards.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Key Concepts

- **Agent** ‚Äì The learner or decision-maker.
- **Environment** ‚Äì Everything the agent interacts with.
- **State (S)** ‚Äì The current situation of the agent.
- **Action (A)** ‚Äì A choice made by the agent.
- **Reward (R)** ‚Äì Feedback received after an action.
- **Policy (œÄ)** ‚Äì The strategy defining the agent‚Äôs actions based on states.
- **Value Function** ‚Äì Estimates how good a particular state or action is.
- **Exploration vs. Exploitation** ‚Äì Balancing trying new actions vs. using known rewarding ones.

           |       Agent       |
           | (Learns Policy œÄ) |
           +---------+---------+
                     |
                     | Action (A)

           +-------------------+
           |   Environment     |
           | (Gives Reward R & |
           |  Next State S')   |
           +---------+---------+
                     ^
                     | Reward (R), State (S')
                     |
           +---------+---------+
           |       Agent       |

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Types of Reinforcement Learning

- **Value-Based Methods** ‚Äì Learn a value function (e.g., Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks).
- **Policy-Based Methods** ‚Äì Directly learn the policy (e.g., REINFORCE).
- **Actor-Critic Methods** ‚Äì Combine both (e.g., A3C, PPO).
- **Model-Based RL** ‚Äì The agent builds a model of the environment to plan ahead.
